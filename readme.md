# Extremely Simple Interpreter

## introduce

ESI is a project that I started for learning complier theory.

My friend [Chipen](https://github.com/zsiothsu) and [Ruslan's Blog](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) inspire me.

It is still an extremely crude work-in-progress, so I will keep working on it until the project is more complete before writing more details.

## Licence

MIT.
